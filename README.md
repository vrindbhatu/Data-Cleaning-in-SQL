# Data-Cleaning-in-SQL


I have performed Data Cleaning on Nashville dataset by using structured query language.

Query 1: For the first query I have added a new column SaleDateConverted in which I updated the SaleDate column by removing the timestamp formart and only keeping
MM/DD/YYYY format

Ouput for the resulted query:
